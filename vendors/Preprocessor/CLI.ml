       Layout of the command line

         There are two types of argument on the command line: options
         and anonymous arguments. Options may have two forms: a short
         one introduced by a single dash character (-) and a long one
         introduced by a double dash (--).

         Options may have an argument attached. For the long form, the
         syntax is "--option=argument". For the short form, there are
         two possible syntaxes: "-o argument" (argument doesn't start
         with a dash) and "-oargument"

         Short options that refuse arguments may be concatenated, as in
         "-opq".

         The special argument -- interrupts the parsing of options:
         all the remaining arguments are arguments even they start
         with a dash.

       Command line specification

         A specification lists the possible options and describe what
         to do when they are found; it also gives the action for
         anonymous arguments and for the special option - (a single
         dash alone).

         The specification for a single option is a tuple
         [(short_form, long_form, action, handler)] where:

         - [short_form] is the character for the short form of the
           option without the leading - (or [noshort='\000'] if the
           option does not have a short form)

         - [long_form] is the string for the long form of the option
           without the leading -- (or [nolong=""] if no long form)

         - [(action : (unit -> unit) option)] gives the action to be
           executed when the option is found without an argument

         - [(handler : (string -> unit) option)] specifies how to
           handle the argument when the option is found with the
           argument

         According to the pair [(action, handler)], the corresponding
         option may, must or mustn't have an argument :

         - [(Some _, Some _)]: the option may have an argument; the
           short form can't be concatenated with other options (even
           if the user does not want to provide an argument). The
           behaviour (handler/action) is determined by the presence of
           the argument.

         - [(Some _, None)]: the option must not have an argument; the
           short form, if it exists, may be concatenated

         - [(None, Some _)]: the option must have an argument; the
           short form can't be concatenated

         - [(None, None)]: not allowed *)

        noshort, "show-pp", set show_pp true, None;

        noshort, "cli",     set cli true, None;

    (* Handler of anonymous arguments.

       The test on [arg] is for the hack below not to trigger the
       error "Multiple inputs" for erased options. *)

    let anonymous arg =
      if arg <> "" then
        match !input with
          None -> input := Some arg
        | Some _ -> raise (Getopt.Error "Multiple inputs.")

    (* Parsing the command-line options *)

    (* We do not want the exception [Getopt.Error] to be raised when
       finding an unknown option.

         The following is a hack to filter out unknown options but
       leaving correct ones, even if their syntax is invalid and will
       result in an exception [Getopt.Error] raised by
       [Getopt.parse_cmdline] below.

         IMPORTANT: We assume that there are no concatenated short
       options (here, the only possible combinations are "-hv" and
       "-vh") and that anonymous arguments (here, a unique text file)
       is given after "--".

         First, we make a backup copy of [Sys.argv]. Second, we filter
       it in a list by calling [Argv.filter]. That function performs a
       side effect on [Sys.argv]: unknown options are removed and
       compacted. That is why [Sys.argv] has to be restored from the
       backup after parsing the command-line: another parse is now
       possible by another client. *)
