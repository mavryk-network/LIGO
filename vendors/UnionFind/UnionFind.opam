synopsis     : "Some implementations in OCaml of the Union/Find algorithm"
description  : "All modules implementing Union/Find can be coerced by the same signature [Partition.S]. Note the function [alias] which is equivalent to [equiv], but not symmetric: [alias x y] means that [x] is an alias of y, which translates in the present context as [x] not being the representative of the equivalence class containing the equivalence between [x] and [y]. The function [alias] is useful when managing aliases during the static analyses of programming languages, so the representatives of the classes are always the original object."
