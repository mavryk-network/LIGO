  -- A note on configuration initialization: If the client decides to send the
  -- configuration on initialization, then the lsp library will call
  -- onChangeConfiguration to set the config on the server side. However, the
  -- client is not required to do this, and indeed VSCode does not.
  --
  -- So the next best thing we can do is to request and set the configuration
  -- ourselves as soon as possible. The first handler that lsp calls is the
  -- doInitialize handler, but this handler doesn't run in the LspM monad, so we
  -- can't send requests to the client there. The next handler that is called is
  -- the initialized handler, which does run in the LspM monad, so we can request
  -- the configuration here, and that is what we do.
  --
  -- Unfortunately, it turns out that if a LIGO file is already open when VSCode
  -- is launched, it will be parsed by the language server before the
  -- configuration is initialized. This might be because of the way the lsp
  -- library schedules requests. When fetchConfig is called, the request for the
  -- config is added to some queue in the lsp library, behind existing requests
  -- from the client, so it's not actually executed until after those requests
  -- are handled.
