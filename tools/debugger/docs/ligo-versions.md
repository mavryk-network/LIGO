# Various LIGO versions support

Throughout the project (Serokell tools for LIGO) we strive to always have support for the most recent version of `ligo` executable.

However, in case of debugger, I (@Martoon) think that we temporarly need stricter rules as interaction with `ligo` is yet not mature and it introduces breaking changes too often.

## Version compatibility constraints

When debugger functionality is demanded by the user, we check for the `ligo` version.

Keeping things simple, we assume that with `ligo` versions below a minimally supported version we are not compatible and debugger start fails for them.
For the newest versions of `ligo` that are not accounted by our code, we appriory assume that everything is fine; but in case of failure, we make the user know that he is using a potentially incompatible version.

## Minor tests

We can mark some tests as `minor` ones. These tests can fail when the used `ligo` version is only partially supported by us. We can turn them off by passing a `-m` flag to test arguments:
```bash
$ stack test --ta "-m"
```

## Updating version constraints

Constraints on `ligo` version are specified by `isSupportedVersion` function, we have to keep them up-to-date.

For that, let's follow the following rules.

### Upper bound

When anybody notices that a new version of `ligo` is released, he is free to create a commit that updates the upper bound.
This commit can be created in a new MR or in any existing MR just by the way, as upper version bump should happen often and we want to have this process simple.
Running tests is a sufficient proof of that the new version can be treated as supported.

Also, we should periodically check when a new verion of `ligo` is released, e.g. at [this page](https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo/-/releases).

### Lower bound

When we are ready to make a new debugger release then we need to manually trigger a job in CI that runs all tests except for `minor` ones for a `minimal-supported` `ligo` version. This job is allowed to fail. Then we need to check all failed test cases by hand. They may be failing because of some minor changes in `ligo`'s output (e.g. some locations are skipped in newer `ligo` releases). If it turns out that something severe occurred (e.g. they changed the `JSON` schema format) then we need to bump this lower bound version.

In such case, other constraints should be updated accordingly, e.g. it may be that all exclusion rules become redundant.

### Excluded versions

When `ligo` gains a bug that fully or partially breaks compatibilty and we expect this to be resolved without changes on our side, add an exclusion rule for that particular version or a range of versions.
