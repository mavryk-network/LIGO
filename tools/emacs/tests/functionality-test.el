;; Experiments with running tests in batch mode

;; Tests can be run in batch mode with following command:
;; EMACS=emacs-27.2 cask emacs --batch -l tests/functionality-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit

;; Unfortunately for some reason it fails because lsp server is not initialized yet when the
;; request (like lsp-rename) is coming to it. And any attempts to wait for server doesn't succeed
;; The main complication is that `lsp-mode' is asynchronous (`deferred' library is used)
;; Below are some experiments

;; Maybe we should create an issue in `lsp-mode' github about this or ask help with configuration
;; their helper functions, but now we postpone it..

;; Loop until lsp server become `initialized'
;; Problem: sometimes it lock async tasks of lsp server and test process cannot quit the loop
;;          sometimes it completes loop but lsp server still fail with `(split-string nil "\\.")'
