## Description

Atlas does not bring any particular feature reflected directly on LIGO, but the compiler still manages every Mavryk protocol, and contracts for Atlas can be compiled.

With Atlas, the function `Test.stake` now results in an error when called, as by default the testing mode uses auto staking.
