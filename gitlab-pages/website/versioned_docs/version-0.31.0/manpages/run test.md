### SYNOPSIS

**ligo run test** *SOURCE_FILE* \[*OPTION*\]\...

### DESCRIPTION

This sub-command tests a LIGO contract using a LIGO interpreter, no Michelson code is evaluated. Still under development, there are features that are work in progress and are subject to change. No real test procedure should rely on this sub-command alone.

### ARGUMENTS

**SOURCE_FILE**

SOURCE_FILE is the path to the smart contract file.

### OPTIONS

**-s --syntax &lt;SYNTAX&gt;**

The syntax that will be used. Currently supported syntaxes are "pascaligo", "cameligo", "reasonligo" and "jsligo". By default, the syntax is guessed from the extension (.ligo, .mligo, .religo, and .jsligo respectively).

**--infer**

Enable type inference

**-p --protocol &lt;PROTOCOL_VERSION&gt;**

Choose protocol's types/values pre-loaded into the LIGO environment  (edo). By default, the current protocol (edo) will be used

**--format &lt;DISPLAY-FORMAT&gt;**

The format that will be used by the CLI. Available formats are 'dev', 'json', and 'human-readable' (default). When human-readable lacks details (we are still tweaking it), please contact us and use another format in the meanwhile.
