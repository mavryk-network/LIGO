This is where Coq code from [src/coq](../coq) is extracted to OCaml.

(This is in a separate directory only to suppress a warning emitted
when it is placed inside [src/coq](../coq).)

To get more stuff extracted, mention it in the `Separate Extraction`
command at the bottom of [extraction.v](./extraction.v).
