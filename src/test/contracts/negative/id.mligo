(** Preliminary thoughts on ids:

I very much like the simplicity of http://gurno.com/adam/mne/.
5 three letter words means you have a 15 character identity, not actually more
annoying than an IP address and a lot more memorable than the raw digits. This
can be stored as a single integer which is then translated into the corresponding
series of 5 words.

I in general like the idea of having a 'skip' mechanism, but it does need to cost
something so people don't eat up the address space. 256 ^ 5 means you have a lot
of address space, but if people troll by skipping a lot that could be eaten up.
Should probably do some napkin calculations for how expensive skipping needs to
be to deter people from doing it just to chew up address space.
