(* Definitions and lemmas related to order-preserving embeddings
   (OPEs).

   The central concept below is slice categories of categories of
   OPEs.

   See for example "Everybody's Got To Be Somewhere", Conor McBride:
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04085

   An order-preserving embedding from a list [xs] into a list [ys] is
   a witness that [xs] is a (not necessarily continiguous) subsequence
   of [ys]. There can be more than one witness, for example [x] embeds
   into [x; x] in two different ways.

   Here we will work with an extrinsically-typed version of these
   concepts. In particular, we represent objects in the slice category
   of OPEs as lists of booleans: *)

Notation ope := (list bool).

(* Each element of the list says whether to keep (true) or drop
   (false) the corresponding element of the codomain list [ys]. We can
   thus compute the selected list [xs]: *)

Fixpoint select {A : Set} (r : ope) (ys : list A) : list A :=
  match r with
  | [] => []
  | u :: r =>
      match ys with
      | [] => []
      | y :: ys =>
          if u
          then y :: select r ys
          else select r ys
      end
  end.

(* This representation is somewhat improper; a given [list bool] may
   contain more or fewer elements than the list [ys]. Assuming an
   additional length restriction, we could define an isomorphism:

   {r : list bool | length r = length ys} ~= slice category over ys

   Instead, I will treat a too-short list as if it were padded with
   [false] on the right. I will usually simply ignore the possibility
   that the OPE is too long. In some specific cases we will need to
   rule this out, which motivates proving the "length" lemmas below
   (comp_length etc.) *)


(* Now, we define various operations and lemmas on the slice
   category. *)

(* Finding a fixed point of a function on OPEs by iterating the
   function, using the Braga method (see Dominique Larchey-Wendling
   and Jean François-Monin, 2020.)

   This is used to "strengthen" Michelson loops in [strengthen_instr]
   in compiler.v, doing a kind of data-flow fixed-point analysis.

   [fix_ope] will take a function [f] and starting point [x], and will
   iterate [f], taking [x, f x, f (f x)...] until a fixed point is
   found: some x' with [equiv_ope (f x') x'].

   First, the domain predicate [fix_ope_dom] picks out [f] and [x]
   where this process will terminate: *)
Inductive fix_ope_dom (f : ope -> ope) (x : ope) : Prop :=
| Fix_ope_done :
  equiv_ope (f x) x ->
  fix_ope_dom f x
| Fix_ope_step :
  fix_ope_dom f (f x) ->
  fix_ope_dom f x
.

Scheme fix_ope_dom_ind' := Induction for fix_ope_dom Sort Prop.

(* Helper for when we found a fixed point: *)
Lemma fix_ope_done {f x} : bequiv_ope (f x) x = true -> {y : ope | equiv_ope (f y) y}.
Proof.
  intros H1;
    exists x;
    rewrite <- (Bool.reflect_iff _ _ (@reflect_bequiv_ope (f x) x)) in H1;
    exact H1.
Defined.

(* Inversion lemma as per Braga method: *)
Lemma fix_ope_step_inv {f x} :
  bequiv_ope (f x) x = false ->
  fix_ope_dom f x ->
  fix_ope_dom f (f x).
Proof.
  intros H1 H2; inversion H2.
  - pose proof (@reflect_bequiv_ope (f x) x) as H3;
      rewrite H1 in H3;
      inversion H3;
      contradiction.
  - assumption.
Defined.

(* Now the Braga magic: Coq believes [fix_ope] is structurally
   recursive on the domain predicate *)
Fixpoint fix_ope (f : ope -> ope) (x : ope) (D : fix_ope_dom f x) {struct D} :
  {y : ope | equiv_ope (f y) y} :=
  (if bequiv_ope (f x) x as b return (bequiv_ope (f x) x = b -> {y : ope | equiv_ope (f y) y})
   then fix_ope_done
   else fun Hbeq => fix_ope f (f x) (fix_ope_step_inv Hbeq D))
    eq_refl.

(* Copy of fix_ope generalized over [bequiv_ope (f x) x] with an
   equation, to help below. *)
Definition fix_ope' (f : ope -> ope) (x : ope) (D : fix_ope_dom f x) (b : bool) (H : bequiv_ope (f x) x = b) :
  {y : ope | equiv_ope (f y) y} :=
  (if b return (bequiv_ope (f x) x = b -> {y : ope | equiv_ope (f y) y})
   then fix_ope_done
   else fun Hbeq => fix_ope f (f x) (fix_ope_step_inv Hbeq D))
    H.

(* If the function [f] preserves some property of OPEs, then so does
   [fix_ope f]. This can be used to prove correctness for code emitted
   using a [fix_ope]: prove correctness using [x] and prove that
   correctness is preserved by [f], then conclude correctness using
   [fix_ope f x]. *)
Lemma fix_ope_preserves (P : ope -> Prop)
      {f : ope -> ope} {x : ope} {D : fix_ope_dom f x} :
  (forall x, P x -> P (f x)) -> P x ->
  P (proj1_sig (fix_ope f x D)).
Proof.
  induction D using fix_ope_dom_ind';
    intros H1 H2.
  - enough (G : forall b H, P (proj1_sig (fix_ope' f x (Fix_ope_done f x e) b H)))
