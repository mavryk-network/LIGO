## In state 34, spurious reduction of production variant(fun_type_level) -> UIdent
## In state 45, spurious reduction of production nsepseq(variant(fun_type_level),VBAR) -> variant(fun_type_level)
## In state 74, spurious reduction of production sum_type(fun_type_level) -> nsepseq(variant(fun_type_level),VBAR)
## In state 56, spurious reduction of production type_expr -> sum_type(fun_type_level)
## In state 213, spurious reduction of production type_annotation(type_expr) -> COLON type_expr
##

Ill-formed entrypoint declaration.
At this point, the type annotation is complete, the assignment symbol
'=' is expected.
