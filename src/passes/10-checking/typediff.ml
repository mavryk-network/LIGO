 (**
    This modules aims at finding the difference between two large tuple types
    for improved error message during type mismatch.
    For example when type [a * b * c * d * e] cannot unify with [c * d * e],
    the module will find the "diff" between the two, [a * b] here,
    so the message can be augmented into :
    > Cannot unify a * b * c * d * e with c * d * e
    > Diff :
    a  <
    b  <
    c  =  c
    d  =  d
    e  =  e

    The module will try to find the simplest diff between the two lists.
    To find the simplest one, we tell it how costly is a change.

    For example,
    from :  a  b  c  d  e
    to :    a  b  c  e
    The most trivial patch is :
    patch 1 : (keep a) (keep b) (keep c) (keep d) (REMOVE D) (keep e)
    But another possible patch is :
    patch 2 : (keep a) (keep b) (keep c) (REPLACE d BY e) (REMOVE e)

    For the first  patch, cost = 1 REMOVE = 1
    For the second patch, cost = 1 REPLACE + 1 REMOVE = 2
    weight patch 1 < weight patch 2, so the algorithm will prefer patch 1.

    Weights will be used to construct a "cost matrix" to find the lightest patch,
    see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm
