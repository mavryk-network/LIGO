(*
 A pre parser for the ReasonLIGO parser.

 ReasonLIGO has the following challenge which cannot be solved with LR1 parsing
 without doing big sacrifices:
 
 ```reasonligo
 let foo = (x, y);  // a tuple
 let foo = (x, y) => x; // a function
 ```

 and variations of this. 

 To solve this, an ES6FUN token is inserted where we know it's a arrow function.

 This parser can be separated in two parts: 
 - grammar, which is only concerned with arrows, braces, blocks and 
            parentheses. This is expected to be well-formed, otherwise an error 
            will be given from es6fun_error.msg.in. Note that a challenge for 
            these error messages is over-approximation. This means that the 
            error messages are _very_ general.
 - solving, here it's decided what needs to happen for an arrow "=>". The 
            functions 'cons' and 'concat' are important here.

  A list can be either:
   -     Solved: no ES6FUN token needs to be inserted for this code
   -     Inject: an ES6FUN token might need to be inserted
   - Suggestion: an ES6FUN token might need to be inserted at the suggested location
