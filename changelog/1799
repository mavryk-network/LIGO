  property-based testing. It''s composed of:\n- `val gen : ''a gen`: gives a generator
  for type `''a` (must be annotated).\n- `val gen_small : ''a gen`: : gives a small
  generator for type `''a` (must be annotated).\n- `val make_test : ''a gen -> (''a
  -> bool) -> ''a pbt_test`: creates a test from a generator and a property.\n- `val
  run : ''a pbt_test -> nat -> ''a pbt_result`: runs a test for a given number of
  tries.\nThe introduced types are:\n- `type ''a gen`: represents a generator for
  a type.\n- `type ''a pbt_test`: represents a test for a type.\n- `type ''a pbt_result
  = Success | Fail of ''a`: represents the result of running a test.'
