description: '### New `Test.set_baker_policy`\n\nThere is a new `Test.set_baker_policy
  : test_baker_policy -> unit` that allows to set different baker policies as available
  in the testing helpers provided by the protocol. The type `test_baker_policy` is
  defined as the sum type:\n\n```\ntype test_baker_policy =\n | By_round of int\n
  | By_account of address\n | Excluding of address list\n```\n\nIn particular, `Test.set_baker
  addr` is equivalent to `Test.set_baker_policy (By_account addr)`.'
