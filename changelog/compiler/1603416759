merge_request: '853'
title: Fixed 2 bugs in changelog generator (a shell variable wasn't exported but was
  used in a subprocess; the evaluation time of some nix expressions seem to have changed
  so we're invoking a shell command instead of having the nix expression evaluated
  before its inputs are ready)
type: fixed
