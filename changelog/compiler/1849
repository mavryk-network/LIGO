description: As ReasonLigo doesn't seem to have any advantages over Cameligo and JSligo
  and it seems that it is not used much. We decided to remove the support of the syntax,
  in order to focus our effort on other parts of the compiler. We have added a warning
  that we will leave for a few versions and remove ReasonLigo then.
