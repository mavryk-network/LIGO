title: 'BugFix : Use Loop_left instead of Fold_while in compiling imperative loop;
  remove the Loop package which was deprecated and can be replace by recursive variable like this :
   - Loop.Fold_while f x  => f (x) and add make f recursive,
   - Loop.continue x (in f) => f (x),
   - Loop.stop x => x'
   the code for purification of the code is still ongoing, which mean the code of this MR will be removed soon
type: fixed
