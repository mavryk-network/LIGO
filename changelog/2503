Check the [README](https://gitlab.com/ligolang/ligo/-/blob/dev/tools/vscode/README.md) for more details.Fixed an exception that would be thrown when using the language server with Emacs related to decoding `null` from the configuration.The language server now respects `Deprecated` from the Visual Studio Code configuration and emits a warning when opening a PascaLIGO file if that is not set.Configuration changes may now be done dynamically. Previously, a language server restart would be required for changes to take effect.\\n"
