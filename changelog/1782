description: '### New `Test` function: `get_bootstrap_account`\n\nThe new function
  `val get_bootstrap_account : nat -> address * key * string` in `Test` retrieves the nth bootstrap account. Differently
  to `nth_bootstrap_account`, it also recovers the `key` and the secret key (represented
  as a `string`, similar to `Test.new_account`).'
