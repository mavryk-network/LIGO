description: '### Infer `--project-root` when using ligo commands\nNow LIGO will try
  to infer `--project-root` by looking at parent directories,\nThis will make LIGO
  CLI commands less verbose (when using external packages from npm).\n\nIf you need/want
  to specify the root directory of your project you can as always use the `--project-root`
  flag.'
